Hello Welcome,

Below is a code explanation for the whole code.

In this example, we first load the images of the known and unknown persons using the load_image_file() function.
Then, we extract the facial features and encode them using the face_encodings() function.

After encoding the faces, we compare them using the compare_faces() function. The compare_faces() function 
returns a list of boolean values indicating whether the unknown face matches the known face or not. In this case, 
we only compare one face, so the results list will have one element.

Finally, we print the results indicating whether the unknown person is a match for the known person or not.

Note that this is a simple example, and facial recognition involves much more than just comparing faces. 
It's important to use facial recognition technology responsibly and follow legal and ethical guidelines.
